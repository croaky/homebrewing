To brew this sour blonde with apricot, mash at high temp for a short amount of
time: 160°F (71°C) for 15 minutes. The idea is to create a wort with low
fermentability and even some starch remaining. Boil 60 minutes. Ferment with
primary strain at 68°F (20°C) for ale or 62°F (17°C) for lager.

After primary fermentation is complete, rack to your aging vessel of choice
(shoot for as low oxygen permeability as possible to limit acetic acid) and add
Brett/bacteria blend.

Once souring has reached our satisfaction (8-12 months typically), add the
apricots. Select a variety with intense flavor (Blenheim, Golden Sweet, etc.).
You can choose to throw a few pits in for character.

After 2-3 months, rack off apricot sludge and package.
