# Hydrometer

Use thief to take sample of beer into test tube.
Drop hydrometer into test tube.

Spin the hydrometer to dislodge air bubbles.
Record the gravity reading.

Add a thermometer to the liquid.
Take a temperature reading.

Correct the specific gravity based on the temperature of the liquid:

* 50 degrees, subtract .0005
* 60 degrees, no correction
* 70 degrees, add .001
* 77 degrees, add .002
* 84 degrees, add .003

Use this chart to convert corrected gravity to potential alcohol %:

Take the hydrometer reading right before fermentation
and right before bottling/kegging (after fermentation).

Subtract second ("final") potential alcohol reading
from the first ("original") potential alcohol reading.
For example:

```
7% original PA - 2% final PA = 5% approx ABV
```
