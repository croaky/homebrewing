## Brew day

Sunday, June 5, 2016

Fill 8-gallon pot with 3 gallons of water on the gas stovetop.
Heat to 160 degrees.
Turn off burner.

Fill grain steeping bag (cheesecloth) with grains,
tie it shut,
and add it to the pot.

Place the lid on the pot and cover with a thick towel.
Wait 45 minutes (the "rest").

Towards the end of the rest,
run hot water over the bucket of malt extract to soften it.

After the rest,
remove lid and pull grains out carefully.
Slowly dip the bag of grains in and out of the pot about 10 times.
Compost the grains.

Turn on the flame until pot begins to boil.
Turn off the flame.
Add the malt extract, stirring with mash paddle while pouring.

Turn off the flame.
Put lid on the pot.

Create ice-water bath in the sink.
Let the pot cool in the bath until wort is at 70 degrees.

Sanitize the fermenter bucket.
Fill with 3 gallons of water.

Carefully pour the wort from the pot into the fermenter.
The final volume should be 5-5.5 gallons.
Stop as soon as the hop sediment on the bottom of the pot starts to flow over.

Pour the yeast onto the surface of the beer.
Do not stir.
Snap on the lid.
Fill airlock with small amount of clean water.
Insert the rubber stopper and airlock.

Move fermenter to dark place where temperatures stay between 65-75 degrees F.

## Racking day (6 days after brewing, Saturday)

June 11, 2016

Place fermenter bucket on a table.
Sanitize glass carboy ("secondary fermenter"), tubing, stopper, and airlock.
Attach the tubing to the spigot on primary
and place other end down into secondary.

Remove airlock from primary.
Open valve on spigot to drain beer into secondary.
Leave yeast sediment (trub) behind at bottom of primary.

Attach stopper and airlock to secondary fermenter.
Move to cool dark area.

## Bottling day (14 days after racking, Saturday)

June 25, 2016

Remove rubber stopper and airlock.
[Measure gravity][gravity].

[gravity]: ../procedures.md#measure-gravity

Replace rubber stopper and airlock.

Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan.
Turn off the flame.
Stir in 4.5 oz dextrose (priming corn sugar) until fully dissolved.

Place secondary fermenter on a table.
Carefully pour priming mixture through funnel and into fermenter.
Wait 30m or until sediment re-settles.

Sanitize auto-siphon, tubing, bottle filler, and bottle caps.
Add a drop of Star-San to each clean bottle.
Rinse each bottle with water.
Spray thief, test tube, and hydrometer with Star-San.

Insert siphon tube halfway into secondary fermenter
and stir slowly for a minute.
While holding the siphon half way into the fermenter,
raise the inner tube to draw beer into the larger outer tube.

Have a friend push down on the bottle filler inside a bottle
so the spring-valve opens.
Now push the smaller siphon tube down into the larger tube,
forcing the beer up and through.
Gently lower the siphoning unit to the bottom of the carboy.

Fill bottles almost all the way,
as removal of the filler leaves the proper amount of head space
in the bottles (about an inch).

Allow the bottles to sit with the caps sitting loosely on top
until all the bottles are full so that carbon dioxide
has a chance to accumulate in the head space and displace
any unwanted oxygen.

Use the bottle capper to fasten the bottle caps on tightly.

Store the bottles somewhere dark, between 65-75 degrees F.
Carbonation usually takes 2 weeks.
