## Aerate

> The action of impregnating with or exposing to air at various stages of the
> brewing process. Aerating the cooled wort, for example, favors the growth and
> multiplication of yeast cells before fermentation begins.

## Alcohol By Volume

Abbrev: v/v

> A measurement of the alcohol content of a solution in terms of the percentage
> volume of alcohol per volume of beer.

## Alpha acid

> One of the two soft resins in hops. It consists of three closely related
> chemical compounds (humulone, co-humulone, and ad-humulone) and forms 2-14
> percent of the total weight of hop cones and approximately 45 percent of soft
> resins. Alpha acids have a low wort solubility, and about 90 percent of beer
> bitterness is caused by compounds that form during boiling, the most important
> of which are iso-alpha-acids (iso-humulones), which account for most of the
> bitterness. The conversion of alpha acids to iso-alpha-acids takes from one
> half to one and a half hours; this may vary because the solubility of alpha
> acids decreases with increasing wort gravity. During aging, alpha acids
> oxidize and lose approximately 30 percent of their bittering power after one
> year and about 40 percent after two years.

## Attenuation

> The percentage of reduction in the wort's specific gravity caused by the
> transformation of contained sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas through
> fermentation.

## Brettanomyces Lambicus

> A type of yeast used in Belgium for brewing lambic beers. It produces more
> esters than other yeasts and imparts a characteristic leathery or
> horse-blanket aroma to beer.

## Brewhouse efficiency

> The yield of fermentable sugar from the mash, which can be measured directly
> as degrees of specific gravity per gallon of wort (per pound of grist) or as
> an absolute percentage of the dry grain weight which is extracted into a
> standard mash.

## Brew In A Bag (BIAB)

All water needed for the brew is added to the kettle
and heated to strike temperature.

At strike temperature,
a bag is added to the kettle
and the entire grain bill is added to start the mash.

The mash temperature/s is/are maintained by occasional heat applications
and stirring for usually 90 minutes.

The bag which holds the mash is removed at the end of the mash period.
Removing the bag leaves the sweet liquor (wort) in the kettle
ready to be boiled.

## Calcium chloride

> Formula: CaCL2;. A powder, soluble in water and ethanol, used for the
> treatment of water to make it hard.

## Calcium sulfate

> Formula: CaSO4;. The technical name for gypsum, a mineral salt that imparts
> hardness to soft water.

## Diastatic power

> The diastatic power (DP), also called the "diastatic activity" or "enzymatic
> power", of a grain refers to the grain's ability to break down starches into
> sugars. This is determined by the amount of "diastase," today known as
> α-amylase, enzyme present in the grain.

> Diastatic power for a grain is measured in degrees Lintner (°Lintner or °L,
> although the latter can conflict with the symbol °L for Lovibond color).

> A malt with enough power to self-convert has a diastatic power near 35
> °Lintner (94 °WK); the most active, so-called "hottest" malts currently
> available, American six-row pale barley malts, have a diastatic power of up to
> 160 °Lintner (544 °WK).

## Dry hopping

> The addition of loose dry hops to the primary fermenter (when the wort has
> cooled down to 75 °F, 24 °C), the secondary fermenter, or to casked beer to
> increase the aroma and hop character of the finished beer without
> significantly affecting its bitterness. Homebrewers usually add 50-60 grams of
> aroma hops or hop pellets per 5-gallon batch during primary or, more often,
> secondary fermentation.

## Esters

> Volatile flavor compounds that form through the interaction of organic acids
> with alcohols during fermentation and contribute to the fruity aroma and
> flavor of beer.

## IBU

> International Bitterness Units (IBU) are a measure of bitterness in beer
> derived from alpha acids in hops.

[IBU Calculator](http://www.brewersfriend.com/ibu-calculator/)

## Kraeusen

> The "rocky" or "cauliflower" heads of foam that appear on the surface of the
> wort during the first days of fermentation. When they reach their peak,
> between the fourth and the seventh day, they are called high kraeusen.

## Original gravity

Abbrev: OG. Syn: starting gravity; starting specific gravity; original wort
gravity.

> The specific gravity of the wort prior to fermentation at the temperature
> under consideration as compared to the density of water at 39 °F (4 °C), which
> is conventionally given as the value 1.000. It is a measure of the total
> amount of solids that are dissolved in the wort.

## pH (potential hydrogen)

> Near their temperature optimum the amylase enzymes have a pH optimum between
> 5.4 and 5.7 when the pH of a cooled mash sample is measured (5.4-5.6 pH for
> beta amylase and 5.6-5.8 pH for alpha amylase [Narziss, 2005]).

> A commonly accepted optimal range for mash pH is 5.2 - 5.7 with 5.5 being
> optimal for starch conversion activity but many authors report wort and beer
> quality benefits if the pH is lowered into the 5.2 - 5.4 range [Kunze,
> 2007][Narziss, 2005].

> Many brewers see a jump in brewhouse efficiency once they correct the mash pH.
> This is the result of improved conversion efficiency.

## Primary fermentation

> The first stage of fermentation carried out in open or closed containers and
> lasting from two to seven days during which time the bulk of the fermentable
> sugars are converted to ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide gas.
