## Aerate

> The action of impregnating with or exposing to air at various stages of the
> brewing process. Aerating the cooled wort, for example, favors the growth and
> multiplication of yeast cells before fermentation begins.

## Bottling

Remove rubber stopper and airlock.
[Measure gravity][gravity].

[gravity]: ../procedures.md#measure-gravity

Replace rubber stopper and airlock.

Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan.
Turn off the flame.
Stir in 4.5 oz dextrose (priming corn sugar) until fully dissolved.

Place secondary fermenter on a table.
Carefully pour priming mixture into fermenter.
Wait 30m or until sediment re-settles.

Sanitize auto-siphon, tubing, bottle filler, and bottle caps.
Add a drop of Star-San to each clean bottle.
Rinse each bottle with water.
Spray thief, test tube, and hydrometer with Star-San.

Insert siphon tube halfway into secondary fermenter
and stir slowly for a minute.
While holding the siphon half way into the fermenter,
raise the inner tube to draw beer into the larger outer tube.

Have a friend push down on the bottle filler inside a bottle
so the spring-valve opens.
Now push the smaller siphon tube down into the larger tube,
forcing the beer up and through.
Gently lower the siphoning unit to the bottom of the carboy.

Fill bottles almost all the way,
as removal of the filler leaves the proper amount of head space
in the bottles (about an inch).

Allow the bottles to sit with the caps sitting loosely on top
until all the bottles are full so that carbon dioxide
has a chance to accumulate in the head space and displace
any unwanted oxygen.

Use the bottle capper to fasten the bottle caps on tightly.

## Brew In A Bag (BIAB)

The [Basics of BIAB][basics].

[basics]: http://biabrewer.info/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=194&sid=04e1faaa161ad924c83558c34a7d7abf

> 1. All liquor needed for the brew is added to the kettle and heated to strike
>    temperature.
> 2. At strike temperature, a bag is added to the kettle and the entire grain
>    bill is added to start the mash.
> 3. The mash temperature/s is/are maintained by occasional heat applications
>    and stirring for usually 90 minutes.
> 4. The bag which holds the mash is removed at the end of the mash period or,
>    alternatively, after a mashout. The action of removing the bag leaves the
>    sweet liquor (or wort) in the kettle ready to be boiled.

## Measure gravity

Sanitize thief with Star-San.
Use thief to take sample of beer into test tube.

Drop hydrometer into test tube.
Spin the hydrometer to dislodge air bubbles.

Record the gravity reading.

Add a thermometer to the liquid.
Take a temperature reading.

Correct the specific gravity based on the temperature of the liquid:

* 50 degrees, subtract .0005
* 60 degrees, no correction
* 70 degrees, add .001
* 77 degrees, add .002
* 84 degrees, add .003

Use this chart to convert corrected gravity to potential alcohol %:

Take the hydrometer reading right before fermentation
and right before bottling/kegging (after fermentation).

Use this [ABV calculator][abv-calc] to calculate ABV.
