## Aerate

> The action of impregnating with or exposing to air at various stages of the
> brewing process. Aerating the cooled wort, for example, favors the growth and
> multiplication of yeast cells before fermentation begins.

## Brew In A Bag (BIAB)

The [Basics of BIAB][basics].

> 1. All liquor needed for the brew is added to the kettle and heated to strike
>    temperature.
> 2. At strike temperature, a bag is added to the kettle and the entire grain
>    bill is added to start the mash.
> 3. The mash temperature/s is/are maintained by occasional heat applications
>    and stirring for usually 90 minutes.
> 4. The bag which holds the mash is removed at the end of the mash period or,
>    alternatively, after a mashout. The action of removing the bag leaves the
>    sweet liquor (or wort) in the kettle ready to be boiled.

[BIAB Calculator][calc] or

## Measure gravity

Sanitize thief with Star-San.
Use thief to take sample of beer into test tube.

Drop hydrometer into test tube.
Spin the hydrometer to dislodge air bubbles.

Record the gravity reading.

Add a thermometer to the liquid.
Take a temperature reading.

Correct the specific gravity based on the temperature of the liquid:

* 50 degrees, subtract .0005
* 60 degrees, no correction
* 70 degrees, add .001
* 77 degrees, add .002
* 84 degrees, add .003

Use this chart to convert corrected gravity to potential alcohol %:

Take the hydrometer reading right before fermentation
and right before bottling/kegging (after fermentation).

Use this [ABV calculator][abv-calc] to calculate ABV.
