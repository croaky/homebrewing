# Procedures

Common procedures, isolated for linking.

DOs:

* Aerate

* Dry hop
* Measure gravity

DONTs:

* [Mash out][under]

## Aerate

> The action of impregnating with or exposing to air at various stages of the
> brewing process. Aerating the cooled wort, for example, favors the growth and
> multiplication of yeast cells before fermentation begins.

## Bottling

Remove rubber stopper and airlock.
[Measure gravity][gravity].

[gravity]: procedures.md#measure-gravity

Replace rubber stopper and airlock.

Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan.
Turn off the flame.
Stir in 4.5 oz dextrose (priming corn sugar) until fully dissolved.

Place secondary fermenter on a table.
Carefully pour priming mixture into fermenter.
Wait 30m or until sediment re-settles.

Sanitize auto-siphon, tubing, bottle filler, and bottle caps.
Add a drop of Star-San to each clean bottle.
Rinse each bottle with water.
Spray thief, test tube, and hydrometer with Star-San.

Insert siphon tube halfway into secondary fermenter
and stir slowly for a minute.
While holding the siphon half way into the fermenter,
raise the inner tube to draw beer into the larger outer tube.

Have a friend push down on the bottle filler inside a bottle
so the spring-valve opens.
Now push the smaller siphon tube down into the larger tube,
forcing the beer up and through.
Gently lower the siphoning unit to the bottom of the carboy.

Fill bottles almost all the way,
as removal of the filler leaves the proper amount of head space
in the bottles (about an inch).

Allow the bottles to sit with the caps sitting loosely on top
until all the bottles are full so that carbon dioxide
has a chance to accumulate in the head space and displace
any unwanted oxygen.

Use the bottle capper to fasten the bottle caps on tightly.

## Brew In A Bag (BIAB)

The [Basics of BIAB][basics].

[basics]: http://biabrewer.info/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=194&sid=04e1faaa161ad924c83558c34a7d7abf

1. All liquor needed for the brew is added to the kettle and heated to strike
   temperature.
1. At strike temperature, a bag is added to the kettle and the entire grain
   bill is added to start the mash.
1. The mash temperature/s is/are maintained by occasional heat applications
   and stirring for usually 90 minutes.
1. The bag which holds the mash is removed at the end of the mash period or,
   alternatively, after a mashout. The action of removing the bag leaves the
   sweet liquor (or wort) in the kettle ready to be boiled.

## Measure gravity

Sanitize thief with Star-San.
Use thief to take sample of beer into test tube.

Drop hydrometer into test tube.
Spin the hydrometer to dislodge air bubbles.

Record the gravity reading.

Add a thermometer to the liquid.
Take a temperature reading.

Correct the specific gravity based on the temperature of the liquid:

* 50 degrees, subtract .0005
* 60 degrees, no correction
* 70 degrees, add .001
* 77 degrees, add .002
* 84 degrees, add .003

Use this chart to convert corrected gravity to potential alcohol %:

Take the hydrometer reading right before fermentation
and right before bottling/kegging (after fermentation).

Use this [ABV calculator][abv-calc] to calculate ABV.

## Kegging

[![How to Keg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/198/19420122/d1e12526-9399-11e6-9b14-afc101f4c732.png)][how-to-keg]

[how-to-keg]: https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/attachments/0000/1312/Summerzym95-Kegging_How-To.pdf

Cold-crash fermenter in ice-water bath in sink.

Sanitize keg with 5 gallons of water and one half-ounce of Star-San.
Seal hatch, let sit for 10 minutes.
Turn keg upside down, let sit for 10 minutes.
Empty it.

Connect the CO2 tank to the keg.
Turn CO2 tank on for 10 seconds at 5 psi.
This allows CO2 to enter keg, sink to bottom.

Rack the beer from fermenter to bottom of keg.
Seal the hatch.
Set the regulator to 5 psi.

Fill head space of keg with CO2 (listen for gas to stop flowing).
Turn off CO2.
Open keg release valve ("burp").
Fill keg with CO2 again.
Turn off CO2.
Burp.
Fill keg with CO2 again.
This purges any remaining air from head space in keg,
avoiding oxidation.

Use [Table 1 in "How to Keg"][how-to-keg] to determine target PSI.
For my typical 3.5 gallons after a BIAB,
for saisons and IPAs,
after a cold crash,
I target a 10-15 PSI range.

Set the target PSI, turn gas on.
Listen for gas to flow,
rocking the keg to agitate.
This should take about 15 minutes.

Disconnect the gas, let the keg settle for about an hour.

To sample, attach gas line and beer line.
My gas line and beer lines are each 5 feet, 3/16".
Set gas to 10-20 PSI range, to taste.
